# Red_Eye_Detection_And_Removal

The project was implemented during the Image Processing Course, 3rd year, 2nd semester, @ UTCN, using C++ and the OpenCV library. The aim is to detect and remove red eyes from digital images. First, the area 
on the image where the eyes are placed is selected and if necessary, a red-eye removal technique is applied on the photo.
