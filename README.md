# Red_Eye_Detection_And_Removal

The project was implemented for the Image Processing Course @ TUCN, using C++ and the OpenCV library. The aim is to detect and remove red eyes from digital images. First, the area 
on the image where the eyes are placed should be selected and if necessary, a red-eye removal technique will be applied on the photo.
